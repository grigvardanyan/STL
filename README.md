## STL
STL is library for C++ which contains Data Structures.<br />
<br />
**Binary Search Tree** - to store data and Get,Add and Remove elements fast<br />
**Disjoint Set** - to store elements in the set<br />
**Minimum Spanning Tree** - Graph algorithm to find Tree which connect all nodes by most shortest way.To test MST you should also download Disjoint Set<br />
**Conatine**r - Parrametrized List which has Forward Iterator to has access to elements inside array<br />
**Parrametrized Array** - Parrametrized Array which has Random Iterator to has access to elements inside array<br />
**Parrametrized  Queue** - Parrametrized Queue whic is implemented two way first one with array and second one with the List
